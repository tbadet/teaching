> ## ðŸŽ¯ **Goals**:  
> 
> * Understand your background and expectations  
> * Gauge your familiarity with computational tools  
> * Introduce basic command-line operations  
> * Establish the course structure, software, and environment (IBIOL server)  

> ### Part 1: Icebreaker & Q&A  
> #### Expectations and Background  
> * Fill Google [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QVnIie9xxHmPbUCb4M7Pl1DkW3GBsJpzgN6pkZcXsH4/edit?usp=sharing)  
  
> #### Basic Bioinformatics Concepts  
> *  What is a bioinformatic tool?  
> *  Can you name tools youâ€™ve heard of or used?  
> *  What types of questions can bioinformatics help answer?  
> *  What is FASTA / FASTQ / GFF?   

> ### Part 2: Exercises   
> 
> Designed to assess comfort with UNIX, clusters, and basic file handling.  

> **A. Command-Line Essentials**  
> 
> *  Log into the cluster / virtual machine (provide access + instructions)  
> *  Navigate to a specified directory (cd, ls, pwd)  
> *  Create your own folder (mkdir)  
> *  Copy a file to your folder (cp)  
> *  Look inside a FASTA file (less, head, cat)  

> **B. Data Retrieval & Inspection**  
> 
> *  Use wget or curl to download a small dataset from NCBI or ENA  
> *  Uncompress the file (gunzip)  
> *  Count the number of sequences (grep -c '^>')  
> *  Measure file size (du -h)
